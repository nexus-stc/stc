  ABOUT_US: |
    **About us**
    Among the most impactful inventions of humanity such as the wheel, semiconductors or the wing were the invention of writing and advent of mass printing. Use of printing press made possible wide spread of ideas and knowledge. This burst increased the number of educated people and in its turn people started the Age of Enlightenment and shaped modern civilization.

    Why printing provoked such dramatic changes in society?
    Sane beings and knowledge live in a natural symbiosis: knowledge are fruiting and growing while circulated among people and people do the same. We may even note that complexity of human civilization, its achievements and technological progress during all its history have been correlated with the amount of accumulated knowledge and possibility to share and navigate through it.

    Last advances in knowledge management has been brought by modern machines together with AI. It empowered our skills of storing and searching through huge amounts of information to the very high. Today, machines are able to understand all data we've stored in digital form, derive new knowledge, find out inconsistencies in our researches and reveal hidden gems in researches. Today, machines are able to help us to reach the [technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity).

    However, there is one remaining issue: knowledge is usurped by large publishers, corporations such as Elsevier, Springer, Wiley, T&F etc. Held by copyright, the knowledge remains out of reach for many researchers and for many enterprises that could launch the new Age of Enlightenment.

    Knowledge is not just usurped, an entire system has been built which is putting in chains researchers, academia and readers:
    - Large publishers promote and lobby approaches that encourage evaluation of researchers using the number of published articles in journals having high-impact
    - Publishers make authors to pay for publishing tax-funded researches, then readers to pay for access to published tax-funded researches, while peer-reviewing is done for free by other researchers and this activity is considered as "honorable" in academia
    - Publishers such as Elsevier repeatedly carried and carry campaigns against open access

    Publishers managed to own knowledge at a time when anything could be owned. Afterwards, they ignored the advent of the Internet that made copying and mass reading free and went on collecting tribute. Since that times, modern publishers like Elsevier, Springer and others did nothing to spread knowledge but have only built paywalls for keeping knowledge away from those who cannot pay.

    The world is obviously lagging behind modern state of the technologies. The copyrights on scientific publications should have been canceled decades ago but publishers' lobbying and mere slowness of political systems made us to live in the world where almost all researchers are using tools to bypass paywalls.

    Why exactly knowledge and information cannot be a subject of property rights? There are three reasons.

    Firstly, unlike material things, knowledge can be spread without costs. Every bit of knowledge increases prosperity of the entire society in a much greater degree than it takes from its author.

    Paywalls built by copyright holders are making access unreasonably expensive and it deals a huge damage to our future:
    - Doctors can't learn new medicine protocols that may save lives of our children.
    - Engineers can't learn new approaches to build reliable and safe machines.
    - Students can't learn how to build fair and modern society.
    - Your neighbour will remain an ignorant person denying vaccines and supporting wars

    Finally, what is knowledge? The preexistent order of things, it may be discovered by explorers but not changed or owned. Knowledge has no master.

    Our goals, includes but not limited by:
    - Cancelling any restrictions on spread of knowledge
    - Making knowledge replicated reliably, available and navigable for every person on our pale blue dot
    - Bridging AI and accumulated knowledge
    - Promoting continuous education and building the cult of knowledge

  SEED_HELP: |
    Seeding involves downloading and then sharing for others. You have the choice to seed all or just part of a collection of papers.
    To start, you'll need some knowledge of how to use terminal tools.

    **Installation:**
    
    Download [IPFS-Desktop](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/) (optional) and [IPFS CLI]((https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/)) (required).
    
    **Requesting to seed:**

    After installation, ask the bot what you want to seed. Here's how you do it:
    
    Specific Papers:

    Use the /seed command to get papers by their date of issue. For example, to get 500 papers on JavaScript, type 
    ```/seed 0 500 
    javascript```
    
    To get the next 500 papers, type
    ```/seed 1 500 
    javascript```
    
    To get the next 500 papers with filenames created by a specific template, type 
    ```/seed 2 500 {doi}_{suggested_filename}`
    javascript```
    
    Random Papers:

    Use the /rseed command to get a random set of papers. For example, `/rseed 1000` will give you a random 1000 papers. If you send this command multiple times, you'll get different sets of papers which may overlap.
    In response to both commands, you'll receive a CAR file containing a directory with files named according to your chosen template.

    **Sharing the files (Seeding):**

    Save the CAR file to any directory on your computer. For instance, you could save it to `/home/reader/javascript-0-1000-1000.car`.
    Start sharing these files by typing this command in your terminal: `ipfs dag import /home/reader/javascript-0-1000-1000.car`. This may take some time.
    Once done, you've stored the files on your computer and made them accessible to thousands of others. Great job!
    **Note:** Add `--pin-roots=false` to the command if you don't want to pin all content locally and just want to browse the content.

    **Viewing the files:**

    To view the directory, open your browser and navigate to https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<cid>. 
    Here, CID is the identifier you receive from /(r)seed output (marked as Root CID).
    You can also see the directory in your terminal by typing `ipfs ls --resolve-type=false --size=false -s <cid>`.
    You can share these directories with other users after importing them. Just share the CID with anyone and ensure you're online.
    
    **Name template fields**: 
    `md5`, `doi`, `title`, `suggested_filename`, `issued_at`

    ```/trends <start_date> to <end_date>
    <query_1>
    <query_2>
    ...
    <query_n>
    ```
    **Dates**
    Passed in free form, I'm clear enough to understand various options

    **Queries**
    Set as in the search. Remember that all queries by default returns documents that contains at least one word from the query.
    If you pass `fetal hemoglobin` documents containing only `fetal` or only `hemoglobin` will be accounted too. It might be not what you meant.
    Restrict query to `+fetal +hemoglobin`. This query returns only documents which contain both words.

    **Examples**
    Physics of fluids vs. molecular biology
    ```/trends 2000 to 2020
    +physics +fluids
    "molecular biology"
    ```
    Communism vs. memes
    ```/trends 2017 to 2022-08
    communism
    memes

    Как вы можете помочь нам?

    **Подпишитесь**: [Telegram](https://t.me/{related_channel}) - [Twitter]({twitter_contact_url})

    **Поделитесь доступом к статьям**
    Напишите в [Nexus community](https://t.me/+3UReK0DgPeBhOWQy) если вы хотите поделиться вашим доступом к научным статьям. Нам могут помочь:

    - Телефоны с Android 4.4+, подлюченные к институтским WiFi. Через них мы поможем организовать точку доступа к статьям
    - VPS (небольшие, размещенные в UK/US/Singapore) в Oracle / Digital Ocean / GitHub
    - Университетские VPNs профили без 2FA
    - Компьютеры внутри вашей университетской сети, к которым вы имеете доступ для размещения v2ray сервера

    **Станьте сидером**
    Книги и статьи необходимо хранить распределенно и тогда не будет возможности уничтожить хранилище. Такие технологии как торренты и [IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System) позволяют сохранить к себе часть базы данных статей и книг, а затем раздавать их нуждающимся. Все происходит в автоматическом режиме, от вас требуется лишь место на жестком диске и соединение с интернетом.
    Кликните на /seed, чтобы узнать как стать сидером.
